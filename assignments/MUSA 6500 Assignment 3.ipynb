    "# MUSA 650 Homework 2: Supervised Land Use Classification with Google Earth Engine\n",
    "\n",
    "In this assignment, you will use Google Earth Engine via Python to implement multi-class land cover classification. You will hand-label Landsat 8 satellite images which you will then use to train a random forest model. Along the way, you will consider practical remote sensing issues like cloud cover, class imbalances, and feature selection.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Given that hand-labeling data can be time-consuming, you are encouraged to work in pairs or groups of three to share the workload. You may collaborate on generating the hand-labeled data, provided you submit separate assignment files. If you choose to do this, you should all use the same ROI, of course.**\n",
    "\n",
    "You are responsible for figuring out the code independently and may refer to tutorials, code examples, or use AI support, but **please cite all sources**.\n",
    "\n",
    "In particular, we encourage you to consult the [official Python Google Earth Engine `geemap` package](https://geemap.org/), the online course [Spatial Thoughts](https://spatialthoughts.com/courses/google-earth-engine/), and the [Google Earth Engine Tutorials book](https://google-earth-engine.com/).\n",
    "\n",
    "Submit a single Jupyter Notebook containing code, narrative text, visualizations, and answers to each question. Please also upload your classification results as a GeoTIFF and your accuracy assessment as a CSV file. Open a pull request from your fork of this repository to the main repository for submission."

You are free to propose any labels you like, as long as 1) you include at least 4 classes, and 2) you justify why they are appropriate for a remote sensing task (for example, including a label for ice cream shops wouldn't make sense, because those can't be detected from aerial imagery)."

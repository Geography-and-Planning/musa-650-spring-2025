# Reading Materials

Please find below links to tutorials, papers and other resources related to class materials. This selection is quite small, considering the large number of available resources in machine learning. However, I tried to select those that are more accessible and that may help you as initial pointers.
As I previously mentioned, use of external resources is very highly recommended. However, it's important to select those from "reliable" authors/institutions and with difficulty level that matches your background.

## Applied or more conceptual: 

- Machine Learning Crash Course, parts 1,2,3,4 from Machine Learning at Berkeley ( https://medium.com/@ml.at.berkeley )

  > Simple visual tutorials that explain basics of main ML concepts

- Python Data Science Handbook ( https://jakevdp.github.io/PythonDataScienceHandbook )

  > Free online Python book with a section for ML

- Scikit-learn tutorial: statistical-learning for sientific data processing ( http://gael-varoquaux.info/scikit-learn-tutorial )

  > Online tutorial with example codes using SciKit for basic ML problems

- Building Machine Learning Systems with Python ( http://totoharyanto.staff.ipb.ac.id/files/2012/10/Building-Machine-Learning-Systems-with-Python-Richert-Coelho.pdf )

  > A free online book with a good coverage of basic topics and many examples with code

- Applied Machine Learning in Python ( https://www.coursera.org/lecture/python-machine-learning/introduction-4f2So )

  > An online introduction to applied machine learning, focusing more on the techniques and methods than on the statistics behind these methods

- Deep Learning with Python ( https://www.manning.com/books/deep-learning-with-python )

  > A very practical book with step by step code examples in Python


## More technical/theoretical:

- Pattern Recognition and Machine Learning ( https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/research/uploads/prod/2006/01/Bishop-Pattern-Recognition-and-Machine-Learning-2006.pdf )

  > A leading textbook that provides a comprehensive introduction to the fields of pattern recognition and machine learning. It's highly technical rather than practical.

- Deep Learning (http://www.deeplearningbook.org) :

  > An introduction to a broad range of topics in deep learning, covering mathematical and conceptual background and deep learning techniques

###  Week12: Deep Learning Applications

We will learn transfer learning, a technique used for adapting a pre-trained model to a new problem. We will then review few specialized architectures, auto-encoders for unsupervised learning, and UNet for image segmentation problems. We will see an example of a sligthly more complex network architecture, Siamese network, and discuss adverserial networks.

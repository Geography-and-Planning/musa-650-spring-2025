# musa-650-spring-2025
Class repository for University of Pennsylvania spring 2025 remote sensing (MUSA 650)

## Class Structure

Split class 50/50 between theory and practice

Introduce GEE early

All code will be in Python, runnable from this repo. Environment will be managed with poetry. Installation instructions in SETUP. Will need python, git, vscode, gcloud sdk, and poetry. 

A lot of pair programming in class--students should rotate partners each class.

## Teaching Approach

Some things to keep in mind:
- code is mostly debugging
- be patient with yourself
- we will repeat things a lot so that they are driven home

## Things you will learn
- what remote sensing is
- what machine learning is
- common applications of remote sensing for urban planning
- how to use Google Earth Engine
- how to use common remote sensing libraries in Python
- how to use vs code, github, and other relevant tools
